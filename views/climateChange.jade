    h3 A book to help engineers and entrepreneurs get up to speed in the climate change sector.
    h4 by
      a(href='//ifoundthemeaningoflife.com' dest='_new')  Kelsey Breseman
    p How can you use your skills to make an impact on a global scale? As an engineer, climate change seems like an appropriate fit: we can build better mechanisms and systems. But where to start?
    p In the startup world, I've been a first employee, an engineer, and a product professional. But I was embarassed to realize I didn't understand the context or current challenges around climate change. I've spent over a year now learning, taking notes, and testing product ideas.
    p
      b This book is designed to help you (an engineer, entrepreneur, or aspiring climate change techie) move from "climate change is important, but what can I do?" to "I'm interested in working on this specific technology, can have an intelligent conversation about it, and know where to go next."
