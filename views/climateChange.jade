        b How can you use your skills to make an impact on a global scale?
      
      p I've been a first employee, an engineer, and a product professional in the tech startup world. I wanted to take these skills to do work on one of the world's biggest challenges: climate change. I've spent the last couple of years learning, taking notes, and testing product ideas.
      
      p
        b I'm writing this book to help you get up to speed quickly.
      p This book is designed to help you (an engineer, entrepreneur, or aspiring climate change techie) move from "climate change is important, but what can I do?" to "I'm interested in working on this specific technology, can have an intelligent conversation about it, and know where to go next."
