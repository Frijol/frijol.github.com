    p I very much enjoy helping people improve their writing. I was Editor in Chief of my college newspaper for three years, briefly slush read for a sci fi/fantasy magazine, and professionally edited for the Technical Machine blog.
    
    p Do you have work you'd like to improve? I'm happy to help you, for free– be it technical, trivial, or fantastical. Message me on <a href="//twitter.com/selkeymoonbeam">Twitter</a> to start the conversation!
